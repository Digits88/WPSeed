## What is WPSeed?
WPSeed is a WordPress starter theme following the intention of being able to skip the time-consuming first steps when creating a new theme.
WPSeed uses a variety of pre-built objects that allow kickstarting any kind of theme. These objects consist of:
* basic templates
* basic html/scss structure and presets
* responsive functionality including viewport-mixins, rem-based content resizing and a animated mobile menu
* a preset/config scss file managing all colors, fonts and sizes

## Installation
#### WPSeed Theme:
* Clone WPSeed `$ git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:flurinduerst/WPSeed.git` into your `themes` directory.

#### Workflow
WPSeeds environment (Gulp, Bower, Browsersync, asset-builder) uses the [sage](https://roots.io/sage/) workflow.

**Quick-Instructions:** (For Additional instructions and usage please visit [sage theme development](https://roots.io/sage/docs/theme-development-and-building/).)
  * Requirements:
    * Node >= 0.12.x ([nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/))
    * npm >=2.1.5 (`npm install -g npm@latest`)
    * [short_open_tag](http://php.net/manual/de/ini.core.php#ini.short-open-tag) set to true on your VM/Webserver
  * Installation
    * Install gulp and Bower globally with `npm install -g gulp bower`
    * in the theme directory run `npm install && bower install && gulp`
    * done - you can now use gulp to compile and optimize your asset files

## Usage

### General
* All important files provide a description/version at the top. Make sure to read it first.

### Important Files/Folders

##### Functions
* `functions/dev` (Functions used for development purposes)
* `functions/general` (general functions that are not WordPress related )
* `functions/wp` (WordPress related functions)
* `functions/wpsetup` (WordPress Setup including menus, theme supports and general settings)

##### CSS
* `assets/styles/vars.scss` (this is where you start styling. This file manages all colors, fonts and re-sizing)
* `assets/styles/nav.scss` (Navigation)
* `assets/styles/content.scss` (basically everything else)

##### Javascript
* `assets/scrips/main.js` (javascript/jQuery goes here. It will be minimized to dist/scripts/main.js along with all bower components)


##### Templates
The Wordpress default templates (like page.php, single.php) get their content from the associated file inside the template folder. This way all templates are grouped together.

* `str-footer`      footer content that shows up at the bottom of the page (this is content, don't mix this up with `footer.php`)
* `str-subnav`      displays sub-navigation containing child-pages as list items
* `temp-contact`    displays default content + google maps
* `temp-forward`    forwards to the first child-page
* `temp-home`       displays default content + teaser image
* `temp-onepage`    displays all pages within their respective template in a one page
* `temp-subcontent` displays default content + content of respective child pages
* `wp-home`         WP blog default
* `wp-page`         WP page default
* `wp-single`       WP post default

All templates are seperate into three categories recognizable by their prefix:
* **`wp`**: wordpress default templates. examples: `wp-page.php`, `wp-single.php`
* **`temp`**: individual site templates. examples: `temp-team.php`, `temp-contact.php`
* **`str`**: structure files that have to be included (typically multiple types) in other sites or the main structure.
